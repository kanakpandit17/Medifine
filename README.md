# Medifine:Track your BMI

Problem Statement: 
Medifine is a community App to check the BMI of the people. In India, obesity has been a big problem and to tackle it, this app could be used by the community to check their BMI and realise their health status. A patient’s BMI will be used by medics as a biometric marker with regards their overall health. The likelihood of a patient developing chronic illnesses such as heart disease, anorexia or diabetes can hinge on having a healthy BMI. Your BMI won’t lie. It will tell you whether or not you’re a healthy weight, which should serve as a good wake up call to set some health and fitness priorities.

Proposed Solution:
According to the World Health Organization Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure for indicating nutritional status in adults. In the application developed, users will be able to calculate their BMI by giving height (in cm) and weight (in kg’s) as input. The user can then compare their mass index status with standard values.

Functionality and Concepts used: 
1.	Constraint Layout : Most of the activities in the app uses a flexible constraint layout, which is easy to handle for different screen sizes.
2.  Simple & Easy Views Design : Use of familiar audience EditText with hints and interactive buttons made it easier for students to register or sign in without providing any detailed instructions pages. Apps also uses App Navigation to switch between different screens.
3.	Firebase – To manipulate data in Google powered databases in real time.
4.	Figma – To design the UI/UX of the app.  Figma is a digital design and prototyping tool. It is a UI and UX design application that can be used to create websites, apps, or smaller user interface components that can be integrated into other projects

Application Link & Future Scope:
FOllowing is the link of our app:
•	The application be further developed according to user feedbacks. 
•	Also, we can generate the lists of nearby hospitals/dieticians through API which fetches the related database.
•	The app can help anyone to check their health status and hence, they could make their diet and fitness plan accordingly.
